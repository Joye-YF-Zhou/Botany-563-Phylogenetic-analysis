Phylogenetic analysis of Carbonic Anhydrase Gene family in Arthropods

QC details: I am using data that are uploaded on genome databases by other researchers. Therefore, I will not perform quality control using QC. Instead, I will perform my own "quality control" by selecting good genome that are gathered with NGS. This could be determined through BLASTing known D.mel paralogs. I omitt species that gives out multiple predicted paralogs that are >100 aa. 

Data details: I am collecting paralogs from various online databases, including Ensembl,Genbank,i5k,FlyBase,FleaBase,and WormBase. Once the new E.aff genome comes out, I will use local BLAST to update my paralogs. 

2/12:
constructed a preliminary tree ---- align from seperate clades w high Bootstrap values. 
Manual align ---- start all paralogs from the same point --- manually align from aa.
