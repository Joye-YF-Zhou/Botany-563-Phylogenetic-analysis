# Botany-563-Phylogenetic-analysis
Hello, this is Yifei "Joye" Zhou's research project on the evolution of Carbonic Anhydrase gene across arthropods. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is an essential Zn-metalloenzyme involved in a wide variety of physiological processes such as cellular respiration, ion transport, acid-base regulation, and cellular growth1. It catalyzes the reaction H2O + CO2 â‡„ H+ + HCO3-. CA also plays a prominent role in crustacean ion transport by generating hydrogen and bicarbonate ions to be pumped out of the epithelial cells in exchange for Na+ and Cl-, respectively. The gene family alpha-CA is extremely diverse, yet little is known about them in arthropods. The number and function of paralogs, timing of CA duplication events, and signatures of selection is poorly understood. This study will be the first comprehensive phylogenetic analysis on the alpha-CA gene class in arthropods.
